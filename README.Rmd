# basel

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of basel is to help you calculate the capital requirements according to the CRR. 

The consolidated version of the CRR from 07/08/2022 is used.

https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02013R0575-20220708


With the current basel package version 0.1.0 counterparty risk calculations can be performed for the following cases:  
- retail exposures secured by immovable property (Article 154 1. ii)  
- non-defaulted exposure for corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks (Article 153 1. iii) including SME and exposures to large financial sector entities




``` r
#calculate the risk weight for a retail customer secured by immovable property 
library(basel)

rw_retail(PD=0.015, LGD=0.10)

```

``` r
#calculate the risk weight for a Corporate SME exposure with total annual sales of 30 Mio. â‚¬ 
library(basel)

rw_corp(PD=0.015, LGD=0.35, SME=1, S=30)

```
