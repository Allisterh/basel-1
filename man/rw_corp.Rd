\title{Risk weights for non defaulted exposures to corporates, institutions, central governments and central banks.}
\usage{
rw_corp(PD, LGD, SME = 0, S = 0, AVC = 1, SK = 1.06, M = 2.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{PD}{Enter the PD as a decimal number.}

\item{LGD}{Enter the LGD as a decimal number.}

\item{SME}{SME exposure = 1: For SME exposures to companies where the total annual sales for the consolidated group of which the firm is a part
is less than EUR 50 million, the formula according to Article 153 4. is used. You have to enter the annual sales in parameter S.

Default value is 0 for non SME exposure.}

\item{S}{S is expressed as total annual sales in millions of Euro. It is only used when parameter SME = 1.}

\item{AVC}{Set the AVC factor to 1.25 for all exposures to large financial sector entities or to unregulated financial
sector entities.
Default value is 1.}

\item{SK}{Default value is 1.06 according to the basel formula. You can change the value to 1, e.g. to simulate the effects
from basel IV.}

\item{M}{Maturity value (M) according to article 162 no 1. Institutions that have not received permission to use own LGDs and
own conversion factors for exposures to corporates, institutions or central governments and central banks shall assign to exposures
arising from repurchase transactions or securities or commodities lending or borrowing transactions a maturity value (M) of 0,5 years
and to all other exposures M of 2,5 years.

!!! In the basel version 0.1.0 calculation is only implemented with the factor 2.5. !!!

Default value is 2.5.}
